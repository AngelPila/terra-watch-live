**Usage Instructions**

1. Create an environment file to store the API key. Add it both in the project root (`.env.local`) and inside the `prediction_api` folder (`.env`) with the following content:

   ```
   VITE_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="4a8ecf18eb0954c0c1b546696bfc9719"
   OWM_API_KEY="4a8ecf18eb0954c0c1b546696bfc9719"
   ```

   > **Note:** These API keys are available for reviewers to test the project. However, they will be disabled on **October 8, 2025**.

2. Upload the trained model into the `prediction_api` folder.

3. To run the project:

   * Create a virtual environment inside the `prediction_api` folder.
   * Install all required dependencies.
   * Execute the `app.py` file.
